<h1>OctoberCMS Form Example</h1>

You can copy this code into a OctoberCMS page to see the simple form in action (Replace the layout value with one of your own). 
This example will use some simple form markup to demonstrate how to create a your own AJAX handler to take care of the submission.\
**If using the backend editor, copy the markup and php code into their own section**
