<h1>OctoberCMS Form Example</h1>

You can copy this code into a OctoberCMS page to see the simple form in action (Replace the layout value with one of your own). 
This example will use a custom AJAX handler to take care of the submission, created right on the php code section of the page.\
**If using the backend editor, copy the markup and php code into their own section**
